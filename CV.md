#### Junior Full Stack Developer

I am a junior developer with a background in architecture. Having spent some time designing and building our physical environment, I now look to creating digital products and solutions that can bring value to all types of business at global scale.


Upon graduating from Makers Academy in December 2016, I will be looking for a full stack developer role where I can develop my programming knowledge and be a part of the team that delivers  meaningful and delightful products. I love good design and making ideas into reality.

## Skills

#### Self-driven and Passionate Learner

I have learnt a number of new technologies in short amount of time at Makers Academy. I am a **reflective thinker, open to learning in different ways and see constructive feedbacks as invaluable gems** that help me grow in my learning.  I enjoy revisiting old projects to **refactor code and improve  the design** with new knowledge I acquire.

#### Detail-Orientated

In my role as an architectural designer, I had been involved in coordinating the integration of design, structure and services in technical design. Due to my **detailed-orientated and investigative** nature, I had often discovered potential issues early which effectively lowered our risk and cost as issues were dealt with before construction phase.

This skill helps me greatly in learning new language and writing code. At Makers Academy, the feedbacks I have received from pair programming were that I have strong attention to detail and good at debugging.
