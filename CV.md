#### Junior Developer

I am a junior developer with a background in architecture. After 9 years of experience in designing and building our physical environment, I now look to making digital products and solutions that can add value to all types of business. I am interested in a full stack role where I can develop my programming knowledge and be a part of the team that delivers delightful products. I love good design and materialising ideas into reality.

**Detail-Orientated and Analytical**

In my role as an architectural designer, I had many experiences coordinating the integration of design, structure and services in technical design phase. Due to my detailed-orientated and investigative nature, I had often discovered potential issues early, which enabled us to deal with them before construction and thus, lowered our risk and cost.

### Education
**Makers Academy / September - December 2016**

My interest in digital technology had brought me to join Makers Academy, the leading web bootcamp in Europe which excels at shaping enthusiastic learners into thoughtful developers who care about software craftsmanship. During the last 16 weeks,  we focused on:

- Curiosity and hungry passion for code
- Independent learner and problem-solver
- OOP, TDD, SOLID, MVC, DDD

- Rspec, Jasmine

 **University of Brighton (September 2004 - July 2006)**
- First-class honours in BA Interior Architecture
- John and Heather Lomax Award for outstanding design scheme which demonstrates flair and imagination
