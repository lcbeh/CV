#### Junior Full Stack Developer

I am a junior developer with a background in architecture. I discovered the joy of coding in summer 2016 and joined Makers Academy in September to learn how to build software. To me, it is very rewarding to see how an idea get transformed into a delightful product.

At Makers Academy, I have learnt that there is a craft to designing and writing software so that it can be changed easily, well-maintained and be a pleasure for other developers. I want to write good software that can improve peoples' lives in big or small ways.

I am looking for a full stack role where I can develop my programming skills and be a part of an amazing team that creates innovative and meaningful products.

**Tech Skills: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, RSpec, HTML and CSS**

## Skills

#### Self-driven and Initiative

While at Patel Taylor, I took the initiative to create a guide and summary of important changes in Building Regulations (Part M) for my team in a new housing project. I reviewed majority of our apartment layouts and became a reference point for others in the matter. I was happy to lead and create awareness about the subject and helped other architects to make informed decision in design.

#### Love to Learn

I enjoy learning in different ways - independently, pair-programming, attending workshop and by networking with people who are similar-minded. At Makers Academy, I have learnt a number of new technologies in a short period of time. From having no previous experience in coding, I can now build applications with technologies that I am new to. Below are examples of TDD apps built on my weekends.

| Project | Description | Technology | Testing |
| ---     | ---         | ---        | ---     |
| [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/lcbeh/rps-challenge) | Classic game | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS | RSpec Capybara|
| [Chitter](https://github.com/lcbeh/chitter-challenge)  | Lightweight Twitter clone  | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, DataMapper, HTML, CSS | RSpec, Capybara|

Please see my [Website](https://lcbeh.github.io/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/lcbeh) for more projects.

#### Detail-Orientated

In my role as an architectural designer, I have been involved in coordinating the integration of design, structure and services in technical design. Due to my detailed-oriented and investigative nature, I have often spotted potential issues early on, which helped to avoid preventable defects. At Makers Academy, the feedback I have received were that I have strong attention to detail and good at debugging.

#### Individual, Teamwork and Communication Skills

I can work well as part of a team but also independently. I have many years of experience working as a key team member in delivering residential projects and also as a project designer for a school project. I often liaised with engineers and other consultants to resolve issues in building projects.

For the final project at Makers Academy, in a team of five, we have directed our learning and strategy at building Ensemble, a music collaboration website. We reached our MVP on the second day, had daily stand-ups and great communication (based on Extreme Programming values) throughout the two weeks.
