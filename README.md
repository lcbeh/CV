## Li Chien Beh


#### Junior Full Stack Developer

I am a junior developer with a background in architecture. I discovered the joy of coding earlier this year and joined Makers Academy in September to learn how to build software.

I can write test-driven web applications and learn new languages and technologies quickly. I am looking for a full stack role where I can develop my programming skills and be a part of an amazing team that cares about writing good software and delivering great products.

**Tech Skills: Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, JavaScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, RSpec, Jasmine, HTML and CSS**

## Skills

#### Self-driven and Passionate Learner

I have learnt a number of new technologies in a short period of time at Makers Academy. From having no previous experience in coding, I can now build apps with technologies that I am new to. Below are examples of TDD apps built on my weekends.    

| Project | Description | Technology | Testing |
| ---     | ---         | ---        | ---     |
| [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/lcbeh/rps-challenge) | Classic game | Ruby, Sinatra, HTML, CSS | RSpec Capybara|
| [Chitter](https://github.com/lcbeh/chitter-challenge)  | Lightweight Twitter clone  | Ruby, Sinatra, PostgreSQL, DataMapper, HTML, CSS | RSpec, Capybara|

#### Detail-Orientated

In my role as an architectural designer, I have been involved in coordinating the integration of design, structure and services in technical design. Due to my detailed-oriented and investigative nature, I have often spotted potential issues early on, which helped to avoid preventable defects. At Makers Academy, the feedback I have received were that I have strong attention to detail and good at debugging.

#### Individual and Teamwork Skills

I can work well as part of a team but also independently. I have many years of experience working as a key team member in delivering residential projects and also as project designer in a school project.

For the final project at Makers Academy, in a team of five, we directed our learning and strategy at building Ensemble, a music collaboration website in two weeks.
